###Overview
A collection of programs used for practice working in OpenGL.

###To do list

-Check to see if the code works on any other operating system.
-Organize and rename the directories containing each project to reflect the project's content and purpose.
-Rewrite this README to provide an overview of what each project does and how to run the code.
-Have screenshots of the results of each project, if possible.
