# OpenGL_practice

### Overview
A collection of programs used for practice working in OpenGL.
All programs were assignments or labs completed while as a student at UCR.
This code has only been tested on computers running a Linux operating system.

### To do list

- Check to see if the code works on any other operating system.
- Organize and rename the directories containing each project to reflect the project's content and purpose.
- Rewrite this README to provide an overview of what each project does and how to run the code.
- Have screenshots of the results of each project, if possible.
